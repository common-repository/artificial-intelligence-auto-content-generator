This plugin will create articles automatically based on your own suggestions ( topics ) and in the style you want. All generated contents will be accurate, written in professional, human-like text, and with no grammatical errors. 

Additionally, it will also create related images automatically. From the text description, DALL-E, OpenAI’s image generation system, will create an image automatically that corresponds to the description. 

It works in several languages, including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Italian, Russian, French    

This plugin utilizes OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language model as its underlying technology. GPT is a state-of-the-art language processing system that has been trained on a massive dataset of text from the internet. This means that this plugin uses GPT as a third-party resource in order to generate text.

It works by allowing the user to input a prompt or topic, which will then be fed into GPT. Based on this input, GPT will generate a piece of text that is relevant to the prompt and written in a human-like style. The generated text can be anything from a short paragraph to a long article, depending on the user's specifications.

It also has various customization options, such as the ability to specify the tone and style of the generated text, or to limit the generated text to a particular domain or subject matter. Similarly, some elements of the interface for the chatgpt, such as bot name, heading and subheading can also be changed.

Additionally, it also allows integration of ChatGPT into any page of the website. ChatGPT is a chatbot built on top of GPT’s vast language models. Adding a small shortcode will activate the chatbot in a page and website visitors / members / users will be able to interact with the chatbot conversationally. Chatgpt is the most popular AI system currently in the market.

Overall, this plugin is a powerful tool for generating high-quality, human-like text on a wide range of topics, making it an ideal solution for tasks such as content creation, language translation, and more.

Addition:
It is now integrated with WooCommerce and it can generate high-quality product descriptions for WooCommerce products. It leverages the power of GPT to generate engaging and professional product descriptions that can help increase the visibility and credibility of the store’s products.

Store owners can easily select the products they want to generate descriptions for, and the plugin will generate the descriptions in just a few clicks.

One of the key benefits of using this plugin is that it saves time and resources. Store owners no longer need to spend hours writing product descriptions manually, freeing up their time to focus on other aspects of their business.
